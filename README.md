# Dark Matter Simplified Models Repository

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of three distinct simplified models for Dark Matter (DM) studies, each differentiated by the spin of the mediator particles. The models included are:

- **Spin 0 Mediators**
- **Spin 1 Mediators**
- **Spin 2 Mediators**

These models are essential for theoretical and phenomenological research in DM, providing a framework for exploring various DM scenarios.

## Contents
For each model, you will find:

1. **Mathematica Notebooks**: Detailed notebooks for building the models. These are comprehensive and include all necessary theoretical formulations and computational steps.
2. **.zip Outputs**: Ready-to-use outputs from the Mathematica notebooks. These are packaged in .zip files for ease of use.
